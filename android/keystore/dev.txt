Warning:
The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore D:\Project\kokolive\android\keystore\keystore.jks -destkeystore D:\Project\kokolive\android\keystore\keystore.jks -deststoretype pkcs12".
